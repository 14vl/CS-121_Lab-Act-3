### *How to run the Garden Simulator:*

**1. INSTALL**
- Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
- Use any IDE (VS Code, PYcharm, etc…)

**2. SETUP**
- Open your IDE
- Create new file
- Paste the code
- Save as "garden.py" 

**3. RUN**
- Press the run button (usually on the top right)
or
- Open terminal in your IDE
- Type: python garden.py

#### TROUBLESHOOTING:
*• If "python" fails, try: python3 garden.py*
*• Ensure file is saved before running*
*• Verify Python installation: python --version*


## Acknowledgement

We extend our deepest gratitude to Ms. Fatima Marie Agdon, our instructor, for her invaluable guidance and support in the development of this Garden Simulator program. Her expertise in object-oriented programming and her patient mentorship were instrumental to our success. This project would not have been possible without her insightful feedback and encouragement.
