`The OOP Garden Simulator is a Python program that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts by simulating a garden ecosystem. The program models different types of plants (flowers, trees, and grass), each with unique growth behaviors and food production methods.`

`How to run the Garden Simulator:`

`1. INSTALL`  
`- Download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/`  
`- Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/`

`2. SETUP`  
`- Open VS Code`  
`- Create new file (Ctrl+N)`  
`- Paste the code`  
`- Save as "garden.py" (Ctrl+S)`

`3. RUN`  
``- Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`)``  
`- Type: python garden.py`  
`- Press Enter`

`TROUBLESHOOTING:`  
`• If "python" doesn't work, try: python3 garden.py`  
`• Make sure you saved the file first`  
`• Check Python is installed with: python --version`

`Acknowledgement`

`We extend our deepest gratitude to Ms. Fatima Marie Agdon, our instructor, for her invaluable guidance and support in the development of this Garden Simulator program. Her expertise in object-oriented programming and her patient mentorship were instrumental to our success. This project would not have been possible without her insightful feedback and encouragement.`
